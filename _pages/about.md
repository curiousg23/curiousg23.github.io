I'm George Yu, a third-year PhD student at Cornell's Operations Research and
Information Engineering (ORIE) department advised by Ziv Scully. My research
interests lie in improving system performance and robustness, particularly in
computer systems, with a focus on scheduling techniques. Currently, my projects
focus on developing optimal scheduling policies for tail latency metrics and
applying these policies to datacenter network settings.
